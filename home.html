		<h3>But you can change that!</h3>
		<ul class="boxes">
			<li>
			On the plus side, there are about 1.2 million dogs each year that would love to find a happy home!
			</li>
			<li>
			You can also be a long-term or short-term puppy foster parent. Sometimes, pets are too young to be placed in a shelter; they need a clean, safe, environment to help them prepare to find a new forever home!
			</li>
			<li>
			Studies have shown that just petting a dog can lower the petter's blood pressure and heart rate (while having a positive effect on the dog as well).

		Even if you can't adopt or foster a puppy right now (or ever), there are still some great ways you can help!
		</p>
		<p>Lots of shelters and animal control centers are in need of volunteers; this usually only requires a few hours of time each month, and it basically means you get to play with animals for free!  Shelter animals need exercise, attention, and socialization.
		</p>
		<p>
		Don't have time to volunteer, but still want to help?
		</p>
		<p>
		Your local shelter would appreciate any donation you can make!  Even a dollar would help to pay for an animal to be spayed, vaccinated, and cared for until it can find a loving home. All donations are tax-deductible.
